# Contributing Guidelines

##### General

* Contributor may contribute code, tests, ideas and feedback via e-mail: packages@subscribo.io or via GitHub
* Maintainers may, but not have to use the contribution
* Maintainers may use the contribution in its entirety, or just part(s) of it, modified or unmodified
* Contributor by contributing a contribution is giving consent for using and publishing the contribution under [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) with current or future [license headers](LICENSE)
* Please contribute only those contributions for which you have right to contribute and to give before mentioned consent

##### Contributing code or tests via GitHub:

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit just the modifications, do not mess with the composer.json or CHANGELOG.md files.
* Ensure your code is nicely formatted in the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)
  style and that all tests pass.
* Send the pull request.
* Check that the Travis CI build passed. If not, rinse and repeat.
