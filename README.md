# Omnipay: PayUnity

**PayUnity driver for the Omnipay PHP payment processing library**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Subscribo/omnipay-payunity.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Subscribo/omnipay-payunity)

[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.3+. This package implements PayUnity support for Omnipay.

## Versions

Omnipay PayUnity driver version | PayUnity COPYandPAY version
------------------------------- | ---------------------------
0.2.x                           | 4

## Installation

Omnipay is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, add it
to your `composer.json` file (you might need to add also development version of egeloen/http-adapter):

for alpha version:
```json
{
    "require": {
        "subscribo/omnipay-payunity": "0.2.0",
        "egeloen/http-adapter": "^0.8@dev"
    }
}
```

for development (less stable) version:
```json
{
    "require": {
        "subscribo/omnipay-payunity": "^0.2.1@dev",
        "egeloen/http-adapter": "^0.8@dev"
    }
}
```

and run composer to update your dependencies:
```sh
    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar update
```

## Basic Usage

The following gateways are provided by this package:

* PayUnity\COPYandPAY

Gateways in this package have following required options:

* securitySender
* transactionChannel
* userLogin
* userPwd

To get those please contact your PayUnity representative.

(Note: they are provided usually in the form 'SECURITY.SENDER' etc.)

Additionally these options could be specified:

* registrationMode
* transactionMode
* testMode
* identificationShopperId
* identificationInvoiceId
* identificationBulkId (Note: not sure of having any effect at the moment)

For meaning and possible values of transactionMode ('TRANSACTION.MODE') see PayUnity documentation.

For meaning of testMode see general [Omnipay documentation](https://thephpleague.com/omnipay)

Registration mode prepends 'RG.' to default transaction mode, thus making the request also registration request.
When transaction mode is specified, then registration mode is ignored (so you have to prepend 'RG.' manually, if you want to make the request registration)

### Usage of gateway PayUnity\COPYandPAY

Gateway PayUnity\COPYandPAY supports these request-sending methods:

* purchase()
* completePurchase()

#### purchase()

Method purchase() expects an array with this key as its argument:

* amount

Additionally these keys could be specified:

* currency (e.g. EUR)
* card (using CreditCard object with extended list of attributes, including mobile, salutation, identificationDocumentNumber and identificationDocumentType)
* cardReference
* identificationReferenceId
* brands
* returnUrl
* transactionId
* presentationUsage
* paymentMemo

Option brands could be an array or string with space separated list of (uppercase) brand identifiers, supported by COPYandPAY widget.
For supported brands see COPYandPAY documentation.

Option returnUrl should be an absolute url in your site, where user should be redirected after payment.

You need to provide brands and returnUrl either as part of purchase() argument, or when creating a widget later.

Method purchase() returns an instance of CopyAndPayPurchaseRequest having method send(), which in turn is sending the request and returning an instance of CopyAndPayPurchaseResponse having the following methods (additional to standard Omnipay RequestInterface methods and besides other helper and static methods):

* isTransactionToken()
* getTransactionToken()
* haveWidget()
* getWidget()

Method isSuccessful() always returns false, as the COPYandPAY workflow is as follows:

  1. using purchase() method you acquire transactionToken,
  2. then create or get (using CopyAndPayPurchaseResponse::getWidget())
     frontend widget and display it to customer (you can echo it or render it by parts, see CopyAndPayWidget class for more details)
  3. and when customer fills and sends the widget,
  4. he is redirected to returnUrl provided,
  5. where you can finish/check the transaction (see below)

#### CopyAndPayWidget

Class constructor, methods render(), isRenderable(), renderHtmlForm(), renderJavascript()
and CopyAndPayPurchaseResponse::getWidget() accepts as first (optional) argument array with following keys:

* transactionToken
* testMode (optional; false or true)
* returnUrl
* brands
* language (optional; 2 character lowercase string - language descriptor, e.g. 'en', 'de'...)
* style (optional; 'card', 'plain' or 'none');
* loadCompressedJavascript (optional; true or false)
* loadJavascriptAsynchronously (optional; true or false)

First two parameters are usually provided to the constructor via CopyAndPayPurchaseResponse::getWidget(),
if returnUrl and/or brands had been set on purchase() method, these are provided as well,
otherwise they should be provided manually either through setters of CopyAndPayWidget object or via $parameters argument on rendering.

##### Methods:

* render() - render complete widget
* renderHtmlForm() - render html part - you can use it on place, where you want the form to be rendered
* renderJavascript() - render javascript loading part, you can put in e.g. in html head
* isRenderable() - returns true, if widget can be rendered with parameters provided (if any)
* __toString() - is used, when echoing the widget, returns empty string for non-renderable widget
* getParameters()
* getDefaultParameters()
* getters and setter for particular parameters

#### completePurchase()

Method completePurchase() could be called after customer had been redirected from widget (see above) back to your site.
It expects an array with key 'transactionToken' as a parameter,
however it could be invoked also with an empty array
and you can provide transaction token to returned instance of CopyAndPayCompletePurchaseRequest
via setTransactionToken($token) or fill(CopyAndPayPurchaseResponse $response) methods.
If transactionToken is not provided manually, an attempt will be made to retrieve it from httpRequest, provided to gateway constructor.
(That usually means, that if you do not specify transactionToken, it will be taken from url query of current page automatically.)

After transactionToken is provided to CopyAndPayCompletePurchaseRequest, you can call its send() method and receive CopyAndPayCompletePurchaseResponse, with following methods (additional to standard Omnipay RequestInterface methods):

* isWaiting() returns true when customer did not yet sent the widget form
* getIdentificationShortId()
* getIdentificationShopperId()
* getCardReference()

* getTransactionId() is alias for getIdentificationTransactionId()
* getTransactionReference() is alias for getIdentificationUniqueId()

getCardReference returns tokens, which could be used for subsequent requests, via specifying cardReference option on purchase request
(setCardReference is actually an alias for setIdentificationReferenceId, and getCardReference is an alias for getIdentificationReferenceId)

### Example code

For example code see:

* [Purchase page](docs/example/purchase.php)
* [Complete purchase page](docs/example/complete_purchase.php)
